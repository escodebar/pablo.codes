## Pablo Vergés

Systems-minded software engineer and technical leader.

I work at the intersection of software engineering, architecture, and
organizational design. My focus is on making complex systems — technical and
human — easier to reason about, operate, and evolve.

This site documents how I work, what I value, and the kinds of problems I
choose to spend time on.

### What this site is

- A concise description of my operating principles
- A record of the kinds of changes I tend to introduce
- A way to assess whether working together would make sense

### What this site is _not_

- A personal brand
- A portfolio of shiny projects
- A comprehensive biography
