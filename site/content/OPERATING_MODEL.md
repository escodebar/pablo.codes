These principles describe how I tend to work and make decisions. They are not
aspirational values, but defaults refined through practice.

## Decision-making

- Decisions should be explicit and documented
- Reversible decisions should be made early
- Irreversible decisions should be made deliberately
- Decisions are revisited when learning invalidates their assumptions

## Engineering

- Simplicity beats cleverness
- Tooling serves people, not the other way around
- Sustainable delivery matters more than short-term speed
- Engineering work balances correctness of execution with correctness of intent

## Collaboration

- Face-to-face beats asynchronous for alignment
- Side-by-side work surfaces assumptions early
- Early alignment is cheaper than late correction
- Disagreement is acceptable; surprise is not

## Anti-patterns I actively avoid

- Implicit ownership
- Implicit hierarchies
- Responsibility silos
- Process without purpose
